# Final Project (Unity)
Miguel Angel Tornero Carrillo A00820449  
## Scene Description
The main scene involves Mario and Boo from the Super Mario series, in a dark room with a single flickering light.  
A button can be pressed to make Mario turn around and stop Boo from moving.  
(Due to the minimalistic lighting, it might be hard to view the scene on a screen with low brightness)  
## Instructions
Build the project or open the main scene on the editor (MainScene). Once the scene is loaded, to rotate the camera, simply click and drag in the direction opposite to the desired movement (similar to touchscreen scrolling).  
While the camera is not being rotated, it can be moved by using the WASD/Arrow keys. The direction of the movement will change based on the current rotation of the camera.  
To make Mario turn around, simply press and hold the Space key. While doing this, Boo will stop moving, his shadow will disappear, and the music will stop playing. To resume, simply release the Space key.  
## Credits
The Mario and Boo Unity models were provided by the HelloMarioAssets package: <https://hellofangaming.github.io/HelloMarioAssets/>  
The music used is Haunted House BGM from Super Mario World (SNES).
